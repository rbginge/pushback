Supervising controller pattern in Javascript. 

Designed for applications that are heavily service oriented and don't require any model capabilites on the client-side. A route manager will direct requests to controllers which will capture RESTful services and apply the data to views (templates). The library depends on jQuery and lo-dash (but should (maybe with a little tweaking) work as well with Zepto and underscore). I plan on removing the dependency in the near future.
